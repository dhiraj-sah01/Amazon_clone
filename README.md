# 🛒 Amazon Clone - HTML & CSS Practice Project

Welcome to my **first HTML and CSS project**! This is a basic **Amazon homepage clone** built as a part of my web development practice. The goal was to understand and apply fundamental HTML structure and CSS styling concepts.

## 🚀 Features
- Clean and structured Amazon-like homepage
- Basic responsive layout
- Navigation bar with logo, search bar, and menu
- Product sections with images, descriptions, and links
- Footer with useful links and contact info

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- CSS3

## 📸 Screenshots
*Add screenshots of your project here if available.*

## 📁 Folder Structure
''' bash
amazon-clone/
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── /images
'''

## 📚 What I Learned
- Semantic HTML structure
- CSS styling with classes and IDs
- Flexbox for layout
- Creating reusable UI components like navbars and cards

## 🔧 Future Improvements
- Make it fully responsive on all devices
- Add JavaScript for interactivity
- Improve design to closely match Amazon's layout
- Add product hover effects and a shopping cart feature
